**When naming images:**

* Underscores are converted to spaces. My_File.jpg => My File
* Use of parenthesis breaks the Vue-My-Photos lightbox plugin
  * BAD: My_File_(2012).jpg
  * GOOD: My_File_2012.jpg
* You can create whatever folders you want, and sub-folders
* You can create thumbnails by resizing the images down so that the smallest dimension (WxH) is 200px and adding `_th` to the end of the new file name.
  * Example: My_File_2012.jpg and My_File_2012_th.jpg
* Putting images into folders will assign them a category of that same name so they can be filtered together on the website
